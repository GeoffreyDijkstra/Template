# DEPRECATED
I don't use this package anymore nor has it been updated in a long time.
This is because I switched to twig which is a more extended template engine.
So if you are still using this package or are looking for a template engine, I would strongly suggest using [twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) instead.

# Template
A template system which can be used with any file type.
It's created in a way that will force you to keep your template and code seperated.
See the example below for a demo.

## Installation
This package can be installed through composer by requiring `devorto\template`.

## Issues + Pull Requests
For issues use the "Issues" tab or even better send a pull request to solve the issue :wink:
