<!--
If you look a this design for the first time it can be a little overwhelming but in fact it's quite simple.
Using *_IGNORE ignores everything inside the given template. It only has no name when using it at the root level.
Using *_TEMPLATE you can setup a part which you want a sub template so you can reuse that template over and over again.
The AS command inside BEGIN_IGNORE tells the Template class to replace that whole part with a variable, which in turn
 then can be replaced with content.
